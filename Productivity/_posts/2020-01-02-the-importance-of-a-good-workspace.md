## In this blog I'll be giving a quick summary that shows how you can quickly get started using Jekyll.


The simplicity of Jekyll’s theming layer and writing workflow is fantastic; however, setting up my website took a lot longer than expected.

## What Is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a website generator that’s designed for building minimal, static blogs to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

In this article, we’ll walk through the following:

the quickest way to set up a Jekyll powered blog;
- how to avoid common problems with using Jekyll;
- how to import your content from WordPress, use your own domain name, and blog in your favorite editor;
- how to theme in Jekyll, with Liquid templating examples;
- a couple of Jekyll 2.0’s new features, including Sass and CoffeeScript support and collections.
